# Digital-Voting-System
🗳️ Digital Voting System
A secure and efficient Digital Voting System built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This system provides a transparent and tamper-proof platform for casting and counting votes in a fully digital environment.

🧑‍💼 Admin Panel to manage elections, candidates, and voter data

🧑‍💻 User Authentication for voters using login credentials

🗳️ Vote Casting with one-time voting restriction

🔒 Data Security using encrypted storage and protected routes

📊 Live Result Tallying (optional visibility)

✅ Responsive UI for use across devices

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS (or Bootstrap)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Version Control: Git & GitHub
